# Peter Hawkins, PhD

I apply machine learning at scale to solve problems in the life sciences. I trained as a theoretical physics researcher in Ultrafast Quantum Physics and transitioned via a deep interest in fundamental ML/AI, and a desire to make the world a better place, to applying ML to life science problems. 

I have published first/joint-first author articles in Nature, Science Advances, Physical Review A. Recently I led a study of representation learning for T Cell Receptors, published in Nature Communications, where I worked with a postdoc and intern in my group, as well as others, to train and quantify an ML model trained on \~100M sequences.
